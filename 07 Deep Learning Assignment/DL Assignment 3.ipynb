    "when using an SGD optimizer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** If the momentum hyperparameter is set too close to 1, the SGD optimizer may cause oscillations in the optimization trajectory and can lead to slow convergence or even divergence of the optimization process. This is because the SGD optimizer will attempt to move too quickly in the direction of the previous update, resulting in overshooting the optimum."
